  <p>Wrapping our towels tightly against our torsos, we took seats at a nearby picnic bench. 
    I shuffled slightly to stay in the shadow of the aging wooden pavilion above us, 
    whose mint-green paint coat was peeling all over. The elder members of the 
    Bar-Ilan team – Faculty? Retirees? Students? – offered us some coffee, 'Turkish mud' as they put it.</p> 
   <p>I was always taught to never refuse generosity like this, and especially not in the middle of nowhere 
     from people whose names you don't know. So they poured me a small cup. 
     I put the foamy brown liquid to my lips and nearly choked. 
     I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but this was something else. 
     Bitter. So unexpectedly bitter. In my book, the drink definitely earned the mud nickname. 
     I gulped down more of the beverage, no doubt loaded with caffeine, 
     and tuned back into the conversation, which had somehow turned to the topic of <a href="E06.html">compulsory military service</a>.</p>
