  <p> I can only write through my own eyes. 
    I am a U.S. citizen, born and raised in the States. 
    I am white, and although I identify as transfemme, 
    I tend to present more like a man for now. 
    I was raised Lutheran but haven't attended church regularly in years, and I donâ€™t speak Hebrew or Arabic.</p> 
   <p>However, in this moment, above all: I am <b><a href="A03.html">van-certified</a></b>.</p>
