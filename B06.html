  <p>A gun? More than a little shocked, my friends and I tried to keep our voices down as we conferred. 
    Was this something to be worried about? Who was this handsome man carrying an 
    automatic weapon onto our dig site? Evidently Daniel saw our facial expressions, 
    because he soon sauntered over to let us know this man was merely patrolling the border.</p> 
   <p>I guess he had wanted to see what all the fuss was about. 
     Was he with the IDF? His navy blue shirt said something 
     closer to ‘BORDER POLICE’ on the back, but I can’t be certain. 
     He wouldn’t be the last heavily-armed visitor. Even so, we were told not to worry, 
     and indeed we never saw any kind of incident. 
     I guess we weren’t really the <a href="B0E.html">kind of people</a> they were on the lookout for.</p>
