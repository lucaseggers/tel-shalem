  <p>After completing the season’s excavation, we set our sights on <a href="H02.html">Jerusalem</a>. 
    The quickest way to the holy city from the kibbutz where we were staying was, 
    undoubtedly, Highway 90. 90 is by some measurements the lowest road in the world, 
    passing not far from the Dead Sea. It also runs directly through the center of the West Bank. 
    What did <a href="C10.html">Anath</a> think about our group leaders’ plan? “I would definitely not go on this road if I were you."</p> 
   <p>So naturally, the next day the whole team headed south on Highway 90. 
     It turns out the entire route is within Area C, the portion of Palestine 
     that Israel administers (read: controls, read: <a href="F02.html">occupies</a>). From what I saw 
     it looks like Israeli forces have tried to bring a sense of ‘safe’ 
     ‘normalcy’ to this highway for passers-through: occasional gas stations, newly-resurfaced asphalt, the whole package. 
     It’s worth noting that seventy percent of Palestinian communities in Area C 
     aren’t connected to <a href="D04.html">water networks</a>, and a third of them lack <a href="G03.html">a primary school</a>.</p>
