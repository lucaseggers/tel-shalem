  <p>Whenever I looked up from the floors I was uncovering and saw the northwest horizon, 
    covered in hills and dusty steppes, I couldn’t help but feel like we were somewhere remote, 
    isolated from the world.</p> 
   <p>That notion was, of course, completely incorrect. 
     I was working in one of the most contested regions on Earth. 
     If I wanted to, I could’ve thrown a handful of dirt and hit the barbed wire 
     fence mere meters to my south that encloses the West Bank. 
     So I really should not have been surprised when we started having <a href="B03.html">visitors</a>.</p>
