  <p>I haven’t talked with Mo since I met him that day, 
    but I saw an article last month the Canadian newspaper CBC interviewed him. 
    He said he carries his U.S. passport with him now everywhere as a precaution. 
    "Usually when police stop you, you know, you can give them the American passport; 
    they don't give you any hard time anymore,” he said. I can hear the tension and 
    sadness in Mo’s words: “Everybody is just like trying to avoid each other for a little bit. 
    You know, not to go to their side; they don't come to our side, in a way to make things not too tense.” 
    Gazans and those living near Gaza have seen orders of magnitude more horrors than residents of 
    East Jerusalem, I know. But still, I think about Mo <a href="F0E.html">a lot these days</a>. 
    I hope he can stay safe and continue doing what he loves.</p>
