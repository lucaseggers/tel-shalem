  <p>The greatest concern on Highway 90 ended up being not the humans but the <b>goats</b>. 
    Well, goats led by humans. Herders have roamed this landscape since before the invention of the written word, 
    and I feel a great deal of respect for those whose lives revolve around animals even today. 
    However, that respect did not make the Kia Sorento any stronger or more goat-resistant. 
    In the backseat, Emily helped by pretending to be a BBC newscaster, letting me know when there 
    were herds up ahead with her “GOAT WATCH!” network program. Some were just a handful of billies, 
    but others were hundreds strong, stank to high heaven, and took just as long to cross the road as you’d expect.</p> 
   <p>I saw very few signs or marked crossings for the herders; 
     they just seem to traverse the high-speed traffic wherever the goats pleased. 
     Even on this road hemmed in by <a href="E02.html">borders</a> (both invisible and tangible), <a href="G0E.html">nature defies constraints</a>.</p>
