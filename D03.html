  <p> I'd turn a couple corners as we snaked our way further south. 
    Here, a greenhouse with massive whirring ventilation fans, working hard even at five AM. 
    There, a date palm plantation, where unseen workers had stacked up trunks into a 
    giant mosaic of scaly-looking bark. Most of the sounds actually reminded me of home: 
    crunches of rocks under wheels, birdsongs of swallows flittering from tree to tree, 
    and the hums of <a href="D04.html">paddles</a> turning in aquaculture ponds.</p>
