  <center>One of my favorite moments with Benny came when Emily was excavating an area with large messy rocks,
  just organized enough to make you contemplate whether a human had built them into something, once.
  <br>Emily asked Benny, 'Is this locus a <a href="310.html">wall</a>?', and he squinted at the rectangle-shaped heap of material.
  He didn't say anything for a second or two.
  <br>Then, he strolled over to the outcrop and kicked at it with its foot, with perhaps the energy you might
    feel as a kid when you destroyed your own sandcastle. Eventually the stones crumbled onto the nearby ground.
  <br>Benny turned toward us, a hint of smile in his voice. 'Not anymore.'
