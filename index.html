<h3>About</h3>
<p>This work of hypertext creative writing constitutes my final for the Fall 2023 class Writer's Sketchbook. It is an attempt to capture how I felt and still feel about the time I spent in Israel and occupied Palestine over the summer of 2023, where I helped excavate a Roman military camp bathhouse dating to roughly the second century AD. All of the events I write about in the final really happened, and I tried to portray them as honestly and accurately as possible.</p>
<p>It is impossible and wrong to ignore the violence, terrorism, and genocide that have further engulfed the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel in the months since I visited. My heart weeps for the thousands of innocent people murdered, and for the friends I made this year who have lost family members, spouses, and close ones in the conflict.</p>
<p>Within two weeks of writing this sentence, I will be living in South Africa, a country inextricably linked to its racist colonial past. With&nbsp;<em>Superposition</em>,&nbsp;I am also trying to figure out what my role as an outsider is in unfamiliar contexts, and how to act ethically in places whose long histories make contemporary decisions deeply fraught. Thank you for reading.</p>
<h3>How to use/read this project</h3>
<p>As a work of hypertext writing, this piece relies on HTML <a href="index.html">hyperlinks</a> that direct readers between sections of text. When you enter the piece you will find nine framing boxes that each contain sketches within them; click on the links to follow those stories further. Typically, the <em>very last</em> hyperlink in each portion of text will take you to the 'next' section of a story.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, I am using this hypertext format in part to convey the chaotic and multi-layered nature of my time in Israel, and as such there are many hyperlinks that will take you to other stories or cause you to jump between moments in time and places in space. I humbly suggest that you follow whatever links interest you, even if that places you inside another experience entirely. You can always use your browser's 'back' button to return. So many of these sketches are inextricably linked by their locations and their pasts &ndash; if history described in one sketch didn't happen, another sketch couldn't exist either, etc. Consider embracing that connectivity and the confusion it carries.</p>
<p>Many thanks again. ~Leggers&nbsp;</p>
