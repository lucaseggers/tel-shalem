  <p>Anath's dog, incidentally, barked at me if I ever came into her line of sight. From the time I entered the house till the following morning, continuous barking if she saw me!</p> 
  <p>Anath and her family kept telling the dog "Enough!" or "Stop!" in Hebrew. That word can be written in English as "dai" but to me, who spoke almost <a href="A02.html">zero Hebrew</a>,  
    it sounded exactly like "die". I still remember how absurd and funny the whole situation sounded.</p> 
  <p>I've kept in touch with Anath a bit since then. She tells me her family is safe, though at one point in October, her father was about to undergo surgery in a hospital when air sirens went off
  and the rest of the family had to hide. Her father couldn't get out of bed, so all they could do was wheel him to the center of the ward. Thankfully the hospital was not damaged and the surgery <a href="C50.html">went ok</a>.
