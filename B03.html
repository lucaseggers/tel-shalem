  <p>Just as we wrapped up the first dig day – at around 12 pm, thanks to the summer heat – 
    we heard the sounds of boots on gravel. Someone was coming up the path. 
    Soon, three or four local men popped into view. They were all wearing plain T-shirts and work pants, 
    and they all smiled and shouted friendly greetings. 
    A couple of them had both hands at their bellies, gingerly carrying something heavy.

   <p>It turned out the land directly between the dig site and the West Bank fence 
     was actually a watermelon patch! We had arrived just after harvest time, 
     and the farmers wanted to share the fruit of the field with us. 
     The men sat alongside us in the sorely-needed shade cast by our shipping container, 
     chatting with Daniel and Beriah as we all ate lunch. 
     I have no idea what our colleagues and the workers said to each other, 
     but I do know that those slices were the best <a href="B0E.html">watermelon</a> I’ve ever eaten in my life.</p>
