  <p>A few of us accepted, so I drove us over, following their vans to the end of a dirt road. 
    We soon found that 'the place' was a large <a href="D04.html">irrigation</a> channel, 
    funneling clean water between fields and fish farms. 
    Thick patches of tallgrasses, each maybe ten feet tall and tipped 
    with a delicate yellow seed tuft, hid this manmade oasis from the harsh heat of the outside world. 
    Clad in nothing but my swim trunks, I hesitated at first to jump from the slippery 
    rock face into the channel, but soon I plugged my nose and took the plunge. 
    The water was cold - all the better to beat the heat! Jack, Claire, Raina and I eyed each other, <a href="E05.html">laughing while shivering</a>.</p>
