  <p>I’m a mapper at heart, and when I heard that the dig would be using a mapping software 
    to catalog our finds and plan our next steps, I was elated. 
    Some members of the team didn’t take to the digital approach as easily... 
    I remember one professor sipping a glass of wine while telling me he was “agnostic about [the software].”</p> 
  <p>Anath is quite the opposite – though to be fair, she did build the software in the first place! 
    Every time she drove up to our kibbutz to help us out, she’d stare flabbergasted at the 
    new ways we managed to muck things up. And each time, she’d explain how we could get back on track. 
    She has the pragmatic tendencies of your typical programmer but is also deeply caring. 
    When I didn’t have a <a href="C11.html">place to stay</a> for a night after visiting Jerusalem, 
    she opened her doors and let me come sleep and meet her daughter and their dog!</p>
