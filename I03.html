  <p>You see, technically "Tel Shalem" was the mound just on our right, 
    out of whose concrete bunker crown radiated four concentric halos of thick barbed wire. 
    That local promontory has been building up earth since it was inhabited in the Bronze Age. 
    The Greeks might have called it Ã†non, meaning '<a href="D04.html">fountain</a>.' 
    They got it from the Hebrew word ayn, meaning 'fountain.' 
    The Arab Palestinian village here was called <b>al-Fatur</b>, which British orientalists claimed meant 'fountain.' </p> 
   <p>The roughly one hundred people of al-Fatur were all displaced in the 1948 war: 
     to some, the War of Independence; to others, the Nakba - the disaster. 
     The Israelis have likely had a military installation on the mound ever since. 
     They call it Tel Shalem, which I am <a href="I04.html">led to believe</a> means 'hill of peace.'</p>
