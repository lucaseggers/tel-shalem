  <p> Every morning at the archaeological dig started with words I never understood.</p> 
  <p>The DJ did his shock routine in Hebrew, save for the moments I recognized a ‘Bob Dylan’ 
    or a ‘Michael Jackson’ within his speech. In any case, the car radio was loud, 
    and we knew we could use the energy. My friends, universally half-asleep, 
    gazed out of tinted windows and watched the crimson sun leap over 
    the Biblical scrubland beyond the Jordan River. I, on the other hand, 
    typically kept my eyes on the road, guiding our trusty rental 
    Kia down those <a href="B03.html">gravel</a> backroads it was never meant to <a href="D03.html">travel</a>.</p>
