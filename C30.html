  <p>Beriah is thoughtful, soft-spoken, endlessly knowledgeable, and has quite a dry wit. Whenever we were at the dig site he was always wearing the same Asian conical hat, the kind you might see
  worn by workers in rice paddies, to block the sun's rays. Whenever he misplaced his own trowel (the tool closest to almost every archaeologist's heart), he'd say, "She
  is calling to me." Then he'd stop, pause to center himself, and then somehow immediately find it. Every time. Maybe she was calling to him, honestly I'd believe it.</p> 
  <p>Beriah lost a close family member in the attacks on October 7. Maybe that was an abrupt change of tone, but, well, part of my experiences emerging from that trip include
    hearing about these sudden tragedies through the grapevine, from other students and professors. Pretty much every student on the trip
    loved working with Beriah. I wrote him an email expressing my condolences, and I haven't <a href="C50.html">heard back</a> yet.</p>
