  <b>Every morning at the dig started out the same</b> - with a car radio blasting the voice of 
    a DJ whose words none of us understood, save for the occasional name spoken in a light Israeli Hebrew accent: Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson. My friends, 
    universally half-asleep, gazed out of tinted windows and watched the crimson sun leap over the Biblical hills beyond the Jordan River. 
    I, on the other hand, typically kept my eyes on the road, guiding our trusty rental Kia down those gravel backroads it was never meant to travel. 
    I'd turn a couple corners as we snaked our way further south. At one, an opaque greenhouse with massive whirring ventilation fans, 
    straining to keep their cool even at five in the morning. At another, a date palm plantation, where invisible workers had stacked up trunks into a giant mosaic of scale-shaped bark. 
    <br>Most of the sounds reminded me of home: crunches of rocks under wheels, birdsongs of swallows flittering from tree to tree, 
    and the hums of paddles turning in aquaculture ponds. But even during the Dust Bowl, I don't think the Midwest could get this dry – 
    Israel's 'fertile farmland' backcountry was only made possible by <a href="202.html">piping water</a> from the Galilee. Out here, it's oasis, irrigation, or dust. 
    <br>After flooring the gas and shooting the car up the final hill, zigzagging like a madman to avoid potholes, 
    we'd see the site from afar: Tel Shalem. Sort of.
    <br>You see, technically "Tel Shalem" was the mound just on our right, out of whose 
    concrete bunker crown radiated four concentric circles of thick barbed wire. 
    That local promontory has been building up earth since it was inhabited in the Bronze Age. The Greeks might have called it Ænon, meaning 'fountain.' 
    They got it from the Hebrew word ayn, meaning 'fountain.' The Arab Palestinian <a href="302.html">village</a> nearby was called al-Fatur, which British orientalists claimed meant 'fountain.'
    <br>al-Fatur's hundred or so people were all displaced in the 1948 war: to some, the War of Independence; to others, the Nakba - the disaster. 
    The Israelis have likely had a military installation on the mound ever since. They call it Tel Shalem, which I am led to believe means 'hill of peace.' 
    <br>Of course, I knew only a small portion of this back when I was driving that Kia: I knew the Bronze Age part, 
    and I could see the modern Israeli bunker. No one ever told me much about the centuries in between, at least not until months 
    after my return to the States. 
    <br>Archaeology, I think even more than history, is about finding gaps in our understanding - 
    blank spaces made up of untold stories and discarded pasts. 
    Thing is, though, you've got 300,000 years of Homo sapiens to account for. 
    You have to narrow your focus, of course. But there is also power in keeping some spaces empty.
