    <p>Back on land, we wrapped our towels tight to our torsos and took seats at a nearby picnic bench. 
      I shuffled slightly to stay in the shadow of the aging wooden pavilion above us, 
      whose mint-green paint coat was peeling all over. The elder members of the Bar-Ilan team – 
      Faculty? Retirees? Students? – offered us some coffee, 'Turkish mud' as they put it. 
      I was always taught to never refuse generosity like this, and especially not in the middle of nowhere 
      from people whose names you don't know. So they poured me a small cup. 
      I put the foamy brown liquid to my lips and nearly choked. 
      I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but this was something else. Bitter. So unexpectedly bitter. 
      In my book, the drink definitely earned the mud nickname. 
      I gulped down the rest of the beverage, no doubt loaded with caffeine, 
      and tuned back into the conversation, which had somehow turned to the topic of <a href="204.html">compulsory military service</a>. </p>
