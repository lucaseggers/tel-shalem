      "... and I'm from America, you know. Born and raised, but, I am *so* glad I left. 
      You can't say anything there anymore, someone's always offended, always has a problem with who you are. 
      And I was in a part of Texas where there weren't many Jewish families around. 
      When I got old enough, I knew I'd had it, and I came here. 
      I'm a citizen now and that means serving in the military. I'm proud of that."</p>
    <p>A pregnant pause followed; no one knew where to take our banter after that. 
      One of the grad students further back spoke up, saying jovially, 
      "Elath, tell them about your <a href='205.html'>service</a>!" Other Bar-Ilan students murmured.

      leaned forward as if to whisper a <a href='205.html'>secret</a> to me and my three compatriots.</p>
