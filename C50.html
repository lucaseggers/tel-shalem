  <p>One of the things I've struggled with the most since returning is the muddiness of archaeology, figuratively speaking.
  Pursuing knowledge is a laudable goal, but at the end of the day, my group was given a permit and assistance from the 
  Israel Antiquities Authority, an arm of the Israeli government that not only protects sites and determines how they're interpreted, 
    but sometimes even enforces the law directly. Archaeology can be used to build and reinforce narratives about the past, 
    about present events, about who land 'truly' 'belongs' to. Any investigation into archaeology around Jerusalem reveals just how
    political it gets - search for 'City of David' and you'll probably find what I mean. What we focus on in history becomes more relevant in the present discourse.</p>
  <p>These past few months, IAA archaeologists have been recruited for a new task: identifying human remains in the Israeli settlements outside Gaza. None of the colleagues
  and friends I made in Israel are working directly on that (and of course in the abstract, identifying civilian remains is a emotionally tough and noble job), and I know for a fact that
  Israeli archaeologists can and do oppose many elements of the broader systems of oppression in their country. But influencing structures and institutions is a two-way street.</p> 
    <p>I say none of this to justify or diminish the suffering of my archaeologist friends. No one should have to lose a loved one to senseless violence. Instead I say all of this
      to show you the unease that comes with this story, with the stories I am sharing, and their interlocking parts, institutions, people, histories. 
      That anxiety is real and I wouldn't blame you for <a href="C0E.html">thinking</a> it has merit.</p>
