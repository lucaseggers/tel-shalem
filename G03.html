  <p>On both sides of the road, I saw the valleys get drier and the buildings get taller. 
    The hills of scrubland and desert were dotted with boxy apartment blocks, 
    perfectly rectangular and sometimes ten stories tall. It was the strangest thing... 
    so many complexes I saw had their entire skeleton fully built in firm concrete, 
    yet through the empty window-frames, you could tell their insides were completely hollow.</p> 
   <p>Why were the majority of buildings overlooking this route in a kind of suspended animation? 
     Who was constructing them, and did they just stop or just start? 
     Further along the highway I saw cranes actively working on a handful of apartments. 
     What does that mean? I donâ€™t know. <a href="G04.html">We drove on</a>.</p>
