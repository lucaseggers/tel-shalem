    <p>During his conscription, he said, he had been trained as a parachutist. 
      One day his superiors shipped him over to a main army base outside Petah Tikva, 
      all barracks and supply depots. Army Command set him up in a regiment's house, 
      made of spacious but drab rooms that had been left empty, and kept him under <a href="310.html">surveillance</a>. 
      All the higher-ups would divulge was that he was to be part of a secret mission. 
      "'Take these civilian clothes and wait,' they said." So he waited a full day, 
      and eventually was joined by other seemingly random conscripted men. 
      A grizzled marksman, demolitions people, lots of special forces types. 
      "The next day the air raid sirens went off," he told us, "blaring the whole morning, 
      afternoon, and night, so we knew the war had begun." Egypt had been wanting to fight for a long time, 
      he said as an aside. Everyone was expecting war. "But we weren't being called upon," he continued 
      in a frustrated tone. "I talked to the other men and we saw we were all trained in different things... 
      but together we would be a <a href="206.html">strong unit</a>." </p>
