  <b>The second week,</b> we swam with strangers. 
  The team from Bar-Ilan University arrived at the dig all at once - we arrived one early morning and 
  their mesh tent was already set up, their pants already muddy from kneeling in dusty pits. 
  Our respective work areas were on opposite sides of the Roman bathhouse, 
  separated by a grand cream-colored central mosaic that spanned the gap in between. 
  Kept apart by our goals and our language, 
  I didn't interact much with the Bar-Ilan 'Land of Israel Studies' 
  crew over the first few days. Our interactions mainly involved 
  battling over who got to play music on the beleaguered 
  Bluetooth speaker that day. Hebrew pop tunes soundtracked many 
  of my digging hours, but Gabe only got through the second 
  Madonna song on his playlist before our Israeli <a href="binvite.html">friends</a> protested. 
  <br>The compromise, it seemed, would be ABBA. Lots and lots of ABBA.
