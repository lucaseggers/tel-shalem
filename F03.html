  <p>The peaceful restaurant was surprisingly empty, 
    but as I looked around a large man came out from the back and greeted me. 
    He introduced himself as Mo, the owner of this street kitchen, 
    and graciously welcomed me inside. He had short graying hair that curled over the top of his head, 
    and wore an unassuming plain black t-shirt with a tiny heart logo on it. 
    Soon, I was tasting his delicious maqluba – a Palestinian dish of meat, rice, 
    and vegetables whose name literally translates to ‘upside down’ due to how it’s flipped before being served.</p> 
   <p>As I ate, Mo lingered and chatted with me, telling me about his life story. 
     He grew up in East Jerusalem, and his father was a travel businessman, 
     which explains all the guidebooks and old posters lining the walls. 
     That was in the 1960s, when Jordan controlled this part of the city; 
     I leafed through Mo’s father’s guidebooks, reading his recommended travel packages 
     to Petra, Aqaba, and other sights to the east. In 1967, <a href="H02.html">during the Six-Day War</a>, 
     Israel <a href="G03.html">essentially annexed</a> the neighborhood, but it is still internationally 
     recognized as part of the <a href="F04.html">occupied Palestinian territories</a>.</p>
