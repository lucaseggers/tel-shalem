  <p>Mo left at some point for the US, and lived in the Los Angeles 
    area for almost twenty years before coming back.

    “You know,” Mo said, “I actually feel safer here than I did in LA!” I asked why. 
    “Well, here there are tensions between groups sometimes, but there is no random violence, you know?
