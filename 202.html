    <p>A few of us accepted, so I drove us over, following their vans to the end of a dirt road. 
    We soon found that 'the place' was a large irrigation channel, funneling clean water between fields and fish farms.

    Jack, Claire, Raina and I eyed each other, laughing while <a href="203.html">shivering</a>.</p>
