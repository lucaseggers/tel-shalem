  <p>In Jerusalem, my group stayed in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, 
    a center of Palestinian life since at least the mid-nineteenth century. 
    Narrow streets are lined by cream-colored buildings of every age: 
    Anglican cathedrals from the 1850s, expat hotels from the 1940s, 
    and modern-day three-story apartment complexes have all been built 
    from the same kind of pale Jerusalem limestone (broadly) as the Western Wall itself.</p> 
   <p>On my last day in the city, I was walking through the area when a restaurant caught my eye. 
     It had been shuttered the day before  when we were trying to find lunch 
     (silly us, it was noon on Friday, everyone was praying and resting,) 
     but its beauty was now open to the passersby. 
     The businessâ€™s walls were teal and sea-blue, and hanging on them were 
     concert flyers, <a href="F03.html">travel advertisements</a> from yesteryear, and dozens of photos of Jerusalem.</p>
