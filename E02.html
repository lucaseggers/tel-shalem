  <p> On the second week, we swam with strangers. When the ‘Land of Israel Studies’ 
    team from Bar-Ilan University arrived at the dig, there were more instructions than introductions. 
    We worked on opposing wings of the Roman bathhouse, and we spoke different first languages, 
    so us Americans didn't interact much with the Bar-Ilan crew over the first few days.</p> 
   <p>Our conversations mainly involved battling over who got to play music on the beleaguered Bluetooth speaker that day. 
     Hebrew pop tunes soundtracked many of my hours in the brick-tinted dirt, 
     but Gabe only got through the second Madonna song on his playlist before 
     our <a href="E03.html">Israeli friends</a> protested. The compromise, it turned out, would be ABBA. 
     Lots and lots of ABBA.</p>
