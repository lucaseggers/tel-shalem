  <p>To me, Daniel seemed like he was straight out of the seventies. His standard dig outfit was usually dark sunglasses, a white Panama-type hat above his curly gray hair, and a t-shirt featuring some rock band or other. 
    He always listens to students and has a sharp sense of humor.</p>
  <p>I haven't written Daniel directly since the trip, but I did hear through a professor about an event that happened not too long ago. Daniel works with the Roman wing of the Israel Museum's Archaeology collection,
  and just two days before Hamas's October attack, an American tourist went into the museum and hurled two second-century Roman statues to the floor, breaking them apart into hundreds of pieces.
  Tensions were already high in Jerusalem, and Sukkot was coming to a close too. Of course everything changed a <a href="C50.html">week later</a>.</p>
